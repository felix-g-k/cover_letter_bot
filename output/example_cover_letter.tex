My work has enabled product and management teams to identify user trends, measure digital product performance, and make informed decisions that drive customer experience forward. I am skilled in SQL, Python, and cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, and have experience troubleshooting data pipelines to ensure the integrity and accessibility of analytics data.

Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I have worked closely with product managers, developers, and business stakeholders to assess needs, translate requirements into actionable data strategies, and communicate findings effectively. My exposure to Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban has strengthened my ability to deliver results in dynamic, cross-functional environments.
